# IPA-6 🔍Brewery Finder

<h2>Goal</h2>
<pre>

> Imagine you are now a developer of a web solutions company. As your first project, your client wants you to develop a web application that helps users find brewery locations in their city. This web app should have precise mapping and a wishlist that allows users to save breweries for later. It should also be integrated with Gitflow so it is easier to manage in the future.
> The client has a tight budget and doesn’t have a designer. So the design is up
> to you.</pre>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
The web application should contain three pages.
<p></p>
<p>Breweries list:</p> <pre>A list of breweries with the possibility to filter them.</pre>
<p>Brewery details:</p> <pre>This page is shown when a user clicks on a brewery
on the breweries list page. On this page, there should be a map integrated
with Google showing the brewery’s location. It should be represented
as a pinned location based on the latitude and longitude.</pre>

<p>Wishlist:</p> <pre>On the breweries list and brewery details pages, a user can add
a brewery to their wishlist. The marked breweries should be shown on this
page</pre>
